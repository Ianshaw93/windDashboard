# windDashboard
A web app that estimates wind energy yield for a given location; that will allow users to upload data in csv files to add to the open source network.  

This web app was coded using Python, Flask, HTML and Angular; and will use Google Earth JavaScript API and SQL.    

This app is in early development.

# App So Far
Home Page where user can search for city/area code (this will later be an interactive map - see future features section below)

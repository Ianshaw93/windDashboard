# windDashboard
A web app that estimates wind energy yield for a given location; that will allow users to upload data in csv files to add to the open source network.  

This web app was coded using Python, Flask, HTML Angular and Google Earth JavaScript API; and will use SQL.    

This app is in early development.

# App So Far
